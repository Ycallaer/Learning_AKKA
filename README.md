# Learning AKKA: Building applications and microservices with AKKA
The content of this repo is coming from the online course `Learning Akka: Building applications and microservices with AKKA`
Originally the course is taught with akka 2.4 but I use akka 2.6 to make it more relevant to myself.
This means that the code will not always be the same as shown in the instructional videos.

The biggest difference is in section 5 when they talk about akka remote. Here `Artery` has been used as the original remoting has been deprecated.
